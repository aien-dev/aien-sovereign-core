# Release gate against the REAL candidate manifest (release/candidate.toml, omega.lock, Cargo.lock), CPU only, offline.
# scripts/test-release-checks.sh uses an invented candidate; this one proves the gate refuses a package or tree that
# is not CAND-4, using the committed manifest. No signing key is read or generated; the binaries are throwaway
# scripts, never real builds. Nothing is published.
#
# How the gate binds a package to the candidate revision (scripts/check-release-candidate.sh):
#   tree:    omega.lock == omega-commit, Cargo.lock holds exactly the [pins] revisions.
#   package: release.toml candidate + [model] table match, and with --native the sha256 of bin/aien must equal
#            [executables] aien-cli-native-release. The binary digest is what ties a package to a source revision:
#            a build from any other sovereign-core source gives another digest and is refused.
#   NOT bound: the sovereign-core-commit field in candidate.toml is informational (candidate.toml itself changed after
#            that commit); the executable digests are the binding. A package without --native is refused (no digest).
#
# Mutation note: the negative "post-candidate binary refused" case passes wrongly if the line
#   [[ "$want_aien" == "$exe" ]] || die ...
# in check-release-candidate.sh is removed or weakened (for example `true ||`). The mutation section below applies
# that change to a copy of the gate and requires the negative check to turn red, so it cannot pass vacuously.
