#   2. a valid signed release installs from a checkout
#   3. a tampered archive installs nothing (checksum)
#   4. a release signed by another key installs nothing (signature)
#   5. a standalone copy of install.sh (no source tree, clean HOME) installs the
#      valid release offline when the signer file is given, imprint included
#   6. the same standalone copy with no signer override falls back to the key
#      pinned in install.sh, so the fixture (throwaway key) is refused
