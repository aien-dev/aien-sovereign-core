# Static guard for where the release gate blocks (merge-owner decision on sovereign-core#268, 2026-10-07):
#   release.yml (tag push): every step that runs scripts/check-release-candidate.sh is fail-closed. The only
#     continue-on-error allowed anywhere in the file is the manual dry run:
#       continue-on-error: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && inputs.dry_run }}
#   release-dry-run.yml (every pull request): only the step that runs check-release-candidate.sh on this revision
#     may be non-blocking (main may move ahead of the candidate); the publish guard and the refusal suite
#     (test-release-real-tree.sh) block.
#   scripts/test-release-gate-wiring.sh [release.yml] [release-dry-run.yml]
# Mutation note: the self-checks below inject `continue-on-error: true` into the tag gate step (plain, and hidden
# behind a comment holding the allowed text), weaken the allowed expression, drop the tag gate, put an `if:` on the gate
# step and on its job, and make the refusal suite non-blocking or conditional; each must turn this guard red.
