# and for the native engine AIEN_OMEGA_DIR and AIEN_PHYSICS_DIR at omega.lock / omega's physics.lock.
# Cargo unifies features across every -p in one command, so a digest depends on the group it was built in
# (docs/release/F1-binary-digest-difference.md). The groups are therefore fixed: the packaged helpers as one
# group first, then aien-cli alone and last, each through scripts/repro-build.sh (--locked, path remap).
