# Scoring contract v5 scorer (docs/campaigns/scoring/SCORING-v5.md). Shell + jq only.
# Usage: score-rows.sh DECLARATION.json RESULTS.jsonl [EXTERNAL.json]
#   DECLARATION  frozen declaration of the case set (see SCORING-v5.md section 2)
#   RESULTS      one JSON object per line, one line per run
#   EXTERNAL     optional JSON object of external controls, e.g. {"F0":true};
#                an external control that is absent counts as false (fail closed)
# Prints one JSON verdict on stdout. Exit 0 only if the campaign verdict is PASS,
# 1 for any other verdict, 2 for a bad declaration, unreadable input or a jq failure.
# Nothing here reads the older make-receipt.sh scorers; they stay as they were.
