## Upstream Stewardship Doctrine

AIEN upstream development is guided by [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md). The Constitution defines our technical discipline and ethical commitment to human advancement. As noted in its Governance Notice, the Constitution does not restrict downstream commercial licensees of the software.

## Submission Standards

1. **Mandatory Branching**: Never push directly to `main`. Create descriptive feature branches (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `perf/`).
2. **Sovereign Voice & Anti-Slop**:
   - Zero em dashes (Unicode U+2014) and zero en dashes (Unicode U+2013). Use commas, colons, parentheses, or plain hyphens.
   - Ban formulaic marketing buzzwords and conversational filler.
   - Lead pull request descriptions with technical proof, test output, or benchmarks.
3. **Secret Protection at Rest**: Never commit plaintext `.env` files, API keys, or private tokens. All secrets must resolve through an approved `SecretProvider`.
4. **Verification**: Verify that `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` and `cargo test --workspace` pass with zero warnings before opening a pull request.
