//! Switchboard core (ADR 0030): one typed, deterministic router over our own
//! AI accounts.
//!
//! What lives here: the account list, the job description, a usage gauge per
//! account, the rule table the operator edits as a plain TOML file, the pure
//! routing decision, and the `Runner` trait with a scripted `FakeRunner`.
//!
//! What does not live here: login tokens (the crate never reads, copies or
//! stores any; an account only names a settings folder or a key reference
//! name), network calls, or process spawning. Real program adapters are a
//! later cut.
//!
//! All times are Unix seconds passed in by the caller, so every decision is a
//! pure function of its inputs.
