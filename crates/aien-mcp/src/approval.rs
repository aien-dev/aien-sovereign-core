//! Single-use approvals for the host-owned authority seam.
//!
//! When an [`crate::EffectAuthority`] answers `RequireApproval`, a host approver (a human or an
//! approval service, holding an [`ApprovalDesk`]) may issue one [`ApprovalGrant`]. The grant is
//! bound to one effect identity: the intent digest (tool, arguments, catalog), the idempotency
//! key, the world and the winning J-node. Spending is two-phase:
//!
//! 1. [`crate::EffectLane::authorize_approved`] *reserves* the grant when it mints the
//!    `AuthorizedEffect`. While reserved, no other mint can use it ([`ApprovalError::Reserved`]).
//! 2. [`crate::EffectLane::execute_effect`] *commits* the reservation just before the provider is
//!    called: the grant is now spent for good ([`ApprovalError::Consumed`]).
//! 3. If the `AuthorizedEffect` is dropped without running, or cancelled with
//!    [`crate::AuthorizedEffect::cancel`], the reservation is *released*: the grant is available
//!    again, and expiry, revocation and the effect binding are re-checked at the next mint.
//!
//! Limit: the broker keeps grant state in memory only. A restart forgets every grant (each is
//! `Unknown` afterwards), so a reserved or spent grant can never run twice across a restart; the
//! approver must issue a new one.
//!
//! Replay of a finished request does not need a second approval: the existing effect ledger
//! (keyed by the idempotency key) already returns the original receipt, and
//! [`crate::EffectLane::authorize_and_execute_approved`] consults it for a spent grant that is
//! bound to the same effect.
//!
//! A grant that has not been spent can be withdrawn with [`ApprovalDesk::revoke`]; after that
//! it is refused with [`ApprovalError::Revoked`] and cannot be spent.
//!
//! Expiry uses a host-supplied `now` and `expires_at` in the same unit. The crate reads no clock.
