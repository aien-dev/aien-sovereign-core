//! DUAL decision-site observer for `serve.admit_preempt` (ARCH-0031 §7.3,
//! DUAL-3 instrumentation). READ-ONLY by construction.
//!
//! `AienScheduler::build_scheduled_batch` is the one place in this crate that
//! decides admission, the preemption victim and the prefill chunk allocation.
//! This module lets a caller install a [`DecisionObserver`] that receives,
//! after each decision, one immutable [`AdmitPreemptRecord`] describing the
//! alternatives the scheduler actually looked at, the choice it made, and the
//! resource readings it made the choice with.
//!
//! What the tap cannot do:
//!
//! - It holds no reference to the scheduler, the KV manager or the arena. The
//!   hook receives `&AdmitPreemptRecord` (a copy of already-made decisions) and
//!   returns `()`. There is no return value the scheduler reads.
//! - With no observer installed (`None`, the default) every tracing branch is
//!   skipped and the decision code runs exactly as before. The parity tests in
//!   `tests/dual_decision_parity.rs` and `tests/dual_observer_parity.rs` hold
//!   the serialized decisions byte-for-byte equal in both configurations.
//! - No field of a record is an authority input anywhere. A consumer that
//!   reads one as a gate input fails its gate (ADR 0031 §6).
//!
//! The record names the production state machine's own identities
//! (`SequenceId`, step counter, KV block counts). It introduces no second
//! ledger: every number is copied from a local the scheduler computed for
//! its own decision, at the instant it computed it.
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! // Negative control, held by the type system: an observer cannot change
//! // the record it is shown. `observe_admit_preempt` takes `&AdmitPreemptRecord`.
//! use aien_scheduler::dual_observer::{AdmitPreemptRecord, DecisionObserver};
//! struct Tamper;
//! impl DecisionObserver for Tamper {
//!     fn observe_admit_preempt(&self, record: &AdmitPreemptRecord) {
//!         record.choice.preempted.clear();
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! // Negative control, held by the type system: the hook returns `()`, so an
//! // observer cannot hand a different choice back to the scheduler.
//! use aien_scheduler::dual_observer::{AdmitPreemptChoice, AdmitPreemptRecord, DecisionObserver};
