//! aien-proof: the shared test board for the hive.
//!
//! Every test job is fingerprinted from its command, toolchain, and the exact
//! contents of its inputs. A passing run leaves a stamp; any later request with
//! the same fingerprint, from any agent or worktree, replays the stamp instead of
//! running. An identical job already in flight is joined, never duplicated.
//! Real runs pass a CPU slot gate, a free-memory gate, and (for GPU jobs) an
//! exclusive GPU key. Every real run, pass or fail, is sealed into a BLAKE3
//! hash-chained ledger using the Crumb ledger event format (RFC-0001 section 8),
//! with the run's full output as the payload.
