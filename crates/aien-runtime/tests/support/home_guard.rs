//! Test-only guard for tests that open a compose home (an `rxc_host` handle).
//!
//! omega's `rxc_host` allows `RXC_HOST_MAX_HANDLES` (4) open handles per
//! process (omega `src/runtime/rxc_host_abi.h`); a fifth open is refused with
//! `E_FULL (-5)`. Rust runs the tests of one test binary on parallel threads in
//! one process, so five tests that each hold a home at the same moment fail
//! with a refusal that has nothing to do with what they check.
//!
//! Every test that opens a home, directly or through a `ComposeBridge`, takes
//! the slot first and keeps it until it ends. One slot for the whole process:
//! those tests run one after another, and a single test may hold up to
//! `RXC_HOST_MAX_HANDLES` homes. More than 4 concurrent homes in one process is
//! not qualified here; that limit belongs to omega.
//!
//! Include with `#[path = "support/home_guard.rs"] mod home_guard;`. Each test
//! binary gets its own copy, so the slot is per process, the same scope as the
//! handle table.
