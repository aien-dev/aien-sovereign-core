//! Restart-safe replay protection for approved proposals (sovereign-core #249, part B).
//!
//! Every approved submission is claimed in the compose home's Cortex journal
//! BEFORE anything runs, and its lifecycle is written there as host records of
//! kind `effect` with an `approved_submission` field (never a `phase`, so the
//! effect ledger of crate::effects ignores them; ComposeNote cannot forge them,
//! see effects::check_reserved_note):
//!
//!   accepted      the claim: approval key, request id, approval id, trace id,
//!                 the claiming process (pid + start ticks). Durable before return.
//!   in_flight     written immediately before the compose run starts
//!   committed     the run committed exactly the approved proposal (evidence kept)
//!   failed        the run returned and reported that the World did not commit
//!   not_executed  the claim ended before any run started (refusal after the
//!                 claim, or a crash between accepted and in_flight)
//!   uncertain     the run may have changed the World but completion is not
//!                 proven (run error, committed-but-mismatch, crash in flight)
//!   declared      an operator settled an uncertain claim (what the operator saw);
//!                 it changes the reported state only
//!
//! Invariant: a claim key (approval key, request id, approval id; each on its
//! own) is accepted at most once, ever. Every later submission naming any of
//! them is refused with the claim's state, whatever that state is: an approval
//! is single-use even when its run never started, so no interrupted state is
//! ever guessed into a second run. A retry after a lost response gets the
//! committed evidence back in the refusal (`AlreadyCommitted`).
//!
//! Atomicity: the ledger is rebuilt from the journal under the compose-home
//! lock and the check and the `accepted` append happen in that one locked step
//! (the same pattern as effects::open_intent), so two concurrent submissions
//! cannot both be accepted. The journal is opened with CX_OPEN_SYNC: an
//! appended record is durable when `note` returns.
//!
//! The approval identity and its canonical key belong to crate::approved_auth
//! (`ApprovalIdentity`, `approval_key`); this module never recomputes them. It
//! takes the key and the two ids from the caller ([`ClaimKeys`]).
//!
//! Limits: the ledger reads at most HOST_RECALL_MAX host records in one recall
//! and refuses (fails closed) beyond that; liveness of a claiming process is
//! pid + start ticks (effects::executor_alive).
