//! Reading the requirements out of a goal (see `requirements` for the model).
//!
//! `analyze` is rule based and deterministic. It returns the requirements it
//! recognized AND the spans of goal text that look like explicit measurable
//! requirements but could not be interpreted reliably (`Extraction::uncertain`).
//! A caller must refuse a task with uncertain spans: uncertainty is never
//! treated as satisfied.
//!
//! ## Recognized wordings (case-insensitive; trailing punctuation on a word is ignored)
//!
//! | goal wording | requirement |
//! |---|---|
//! | `at least / no fewer than / no less than / not fewer than / a minimum of / minimum of / min N <noun>`, `N or more <noun>`, `N+ <noun>` | `MinX(N)` |
//! | `at most / no more than / not more than / a maximum of / maximum of / max / up to N <noun>`, `N or fewer|less <noun>` | `MaxX(N)` |
//! | `more than N <noun>`, `fewer|less than N <noun>` | `MinX(N+1)`, `MaxX(N-1)` |
//! | `N <noun> or more|fewer|less`, `N <noun> minimum|maximum`, `no longer|shorter than N <noun>` | `MinX(N)` or `MaxX(N)` |
//! | `<noun>` = `lines` (also `non-empty|nonempty|non-blank lines`: lines are counted non-empty anyway), `words`; `items`, `steps`, `sections`, `headings`, `questions`, `paragraphs` (Min only; singular too) | lines, words, list items, numbered steps, headings, questions, paragraphs (`MinParagraphs`: runs of prose lines, see `requirements::count_paragraphs`) |
//! | `N sentences in|per|for|within every|each section` (or `in every section, ... N sentences`) | `MinSentencesPerSection(N)` |
//! | `a one-sentence|single-sentence X`, `a single sentence`, `just|only|exactly one sentence` (the only such phrase; no part of the file, edit or addition named in the goal) | `SingleSentence` |
//! | `containing|with [just|only] one line that says|reads "S"` / `one line saying|reading "S"` | `AddedLines` exactly 1 and `RequiredPhrases([S])` (a final `.` `!` `?` inside quotes that end the goal sentence is not part of S) |
//! | `sections|headings titled|named|called A, B and C`, `sections: A, B and C`; with quoted titles also `section(s) is|are titled "A"` and `[one] section(s) must|should|will|shall|can be titled "A"` | `RequiredHeadings` (a count before the noun must equal the number of titles; `organise it under three sections titled ...` is read the same). The is/are/be forms stay UNCERTAIN after `each every all any` or with `if unless optionally optional may might when whenever perhaps maybe` in the clause |
//! | `between N and M lines|words` (N <= M) | `MinX(N)` and `MaxX(M)`, inclusive. Other nouns, `from N to M`, ranges like `2-3`, `... or so`, and a range on a part of the document (a countable noun or `gap space distance` right before `between`, or `each every per` within three words) stay UNCERTAIN |
//! | `covers|covering A, B and C` (and `to|should|must|will|can cover ...`) | `RequiredTopics` |
//! | `[must|...] cover|covers|covering N topics: a, b and c` (N equals the list, which ends with the item after its `and`/`or`); a later `... form ... for example X or Y for the first|second|...|last [one]` adds the named forms the word-form rule does not already accept, as `topic (or X)` | `RequiredTopics` |
//! | `include|contain|use|mention the [exact|following|specific|same] word(s)|term(s) X, Y` or `"X", "Y"`, optionally followed by `somewhere|anywhere in it|in the text|file|document|list` (a place that is the whole document; any other place, a choice (`or`), or a count or scope after the list is UNCERTAIN) | `RequiredWords` |
//! | `make sure|be sure|ensure|check that the word(s)|term(s) X and Y [both|all|each] appear|occur|show up|are used|are included|are present [somewhere in it]` | `RequiredWords`; a negator, another verb, a narrower place, a choice (`or`) or a count after it is UNCERTAIN |
//! | `must|should|will|shall|to|also name|mention A, B and C [by name]` where every item is one capitalised word | `RequiredWords` (names); a list mixing names and other words, a choice (`or`), a count or scope after it, or a title with a period (`Dr. Smith`) is UNCERTAIN; a list without names (`the file README.md`, `2024`, `the Smith family`) stays silent |
//! | `include|contain|use|mention the phrase "X"` / `the phrases "X", "Y"` | `RequiredPhrases` |
//! | `add|append|insert|with N line(s)`, `exactly N lines` after such a verb, `a N-line <thing>` after a verb | `AddedLines` exactly N |
//! | `write|put|create|draft|compose|produce|generate N line(s)` | `AddedLines` at least N |
//! | `<bound> N lines is|are needed|required|necessary` (a trailing status word) | the same as the bound without it |
//! | `... section titled "T" that holds at least N words of plain text`, `the last section ... N words of plain text` | `SectionMinWords` |
//! | `N level-two|level-2|second-level|h2 sections titled A, B and C` | `LevelHeadings` (those headings at that level; extra headings of the level are allowed) |
//! | `start|begin|open with a [markdown] [level-N] heading [line]`, then the end of the clause or `that begins|starts with "# "` (quoted, 1 to 6 `#` and one space) | `FirstLineHeading` (the first line of the file is that heading; a marker fixes the level). Negated, emphasised, qualified or unquoted forms, and any other heading wording after `start with a`, are UNCERTAIN |
//! | `include|add|put|provide N [separate] fenced code examples|blocks`, or a bound cue before N | `MinItems(CodeBlocks)` |
//! | `<min bound> N of them|these|those [items|lines|entries]` right after `lines [that] starting|beginning|starts|begins with "P"` in the same sentence (exactly one quoted prefix; singular `line` only after `every|each`; at most four joining words such as `and I want` between the quote and the bound) | `MinPrefixedLines` (at least N lines, outside fenced code, whose text after any indentation starts with exactly `P`). Without that referent, with a negator or a per-section word (`per section heading chapter part`) earlier in the sentence, with another condition after the quote (`and ending with ...`), an upper bound, or no bound cue, the count is UNCERTAIN; so is `N or more of them` |
//!
//! Bare line counts. The VERB decides the reading, no task wording is built in. An
//! edit (the goal names an existing file) is judged on the diff between that file
//! and the exact proposed bytes (non-empty lines of the proposal that are not in
//! the longest common subsequence with the file's non-empty lines); a new file
//! counts as an edit of the empty file. `add 2 lines` therefore means exactly two
//! non-empty lines were added; `write 20 lines` at least twenty. The count must end
//! its clause or be followed by `to in into at for about on saying describing giving
//! listing ...`; `3 lines of context`, `10 lines per section` stay UNCERTAIN.
//! "N-sentence" is NOT read: a sentence count over a whole document cannot be
//! verified reliably (headings, lists, abbreviations), so such a goal is UNCERTAIN
//! and refused. The one exception (sc#336) is a file of one sentence: `a
//! one-sentence|single-sentence X`, `a single sentence`, `just|only|exactly one
//! sentence`, is `SingleSentence` when it is the goal's only such phrase and
//! nothing anywhere in the goal names a part of the file (`each every per
//! paragraph line section top title ...`) or an edit or addition (`add append
//! insert prepend update replace rewrite put ...`); `one-sentence` needs `a`/`an`.
//! A quoted `"S"` after `one line that says|reads|saying|reading` must be read
//! whole: it closes the goal, or is followed by `.` `!` `?` or by a new
//! capitalised sentence after a final `.` `!` `?`; otherwise (unclosed, empty,
//! `"S" in bold`, `"S" and another line`) it is UNCERTAIN. `N words of plain text` without a named section
//! (`section titled "T"`, `the last section`) is a count over an unknown scope and
//! is UNCERTAIN. `cover three topics: a, b and c` is read only when the count equals
//! the list (sc#332); otherwise it is UNCERTAIN.
//! "N lines at least" is a lower bound; "a single line" is exactly one. Left UNCERTAIN on
//! purpose: ranges ("2-3 lines"), "a dozen lines", "three-plus sections", "line count at
//! least 40", counts of shell commands or snippets, level-two headings given as a bare
//! list, and a section title that itself holds a count. "a couple of", "a few",
//! "several" and "add a line" (no number) state no number and stay silent.
//! The machine goal of an approved run ("apply approved proposal for <path> ...")
//! is never analysed; the goal bound into the approval is.
//!
//! `N` is digits or a number word (`one` to `twenty`, tens up to `hundred`,
//! `twenty-five`), at least 1.
//!
//! Safety net: after the recognizers, any number (digits or one..hundred) within three
//! words of a countable document noun (line, word, sentence, paragraph, section,
//! heading, bullet, point, item, step, block, example, question, topic, character, page,
//! table, row, column), a quantity cue (`twice minimum maximum limit or more/fewer no
//! longer than`) near such a noun, and heading or word list cues without a number
//! (`headings for`, `a Summary heading`, `these words:`) that no recognizer consumed is
//! UNCERTAIN. A bare count ("Keep it to 10 lines", "three sections") is therefore
//! uncertain, never silent. Numbers without such a noun ("Fix the 2 typos") are ignored.
//!
//! Rules that keep it conservative:
//! - the counted noun must END its clause: closing punctuation, end of goal, a
//!   joiner (`and or but so then because that which covering`) or one of
//!   `long with total overall titled named called about on including
//!   containing`, or `in total`. "3 lines of context", "5 items per category",
//!   "at least 4 questions in the survey" qualify the count and are UNCERTAIN.
//! - a negator (`not no never without avoid` and contractions) up to 4 words
//!   before, in the same clause, makes the span UNCERTAIN (never inverted).
//! - emphasis or quotes around the wording (`**at least 20 lines**`) are not
//!   recognized and the span is UNCERTAIN.
//! - a bound word with a number and a noun that is not supported (`at most 5
//!   items`, `at most 3 paragraphs`, `exactly 20 lines`, `about 30 lines`,
//!   `between 10 and 20 items`, `35-line` with no verb before it) is UNCERTAIN.
//! - a title list whose parsed length differs from a declared count ("6
//!   sections titled A, B, C") is UNCERTAIN; so is a list item that is not a
//!   short noun phrase.
//! - the title or topic list is the text after the key word up to the end of
//!   the sentence (or `, each|with|which|that|...`, or a count bound); a
//!   trailing `and` splits the LAST comma item (`Who to ask and Glossary`),
//!   so a title that itself contains `and` is only safe inside the list.
