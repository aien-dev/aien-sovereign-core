//! Proposer hook: an approved proposal enters the production compose path.
//!
//! The approval desk upstream (INTERPLANE `ComposeLedgerAuthority`,
//! interplane#77) hands over one file change it approved. `ProposerHook`
//! checks it, then drives it through the same compose run `RunComposeTask`
//! uses: the model Skill returns the approved text instead of calling the
//! model, AEGIS checks it with the bridge's verify callback, the winner
//! commits through the World on a J-Space branch, Cortex records it.
//!
//! The hook grants nothing. It never writes the workspace and never mints an
//! authorization: the effect still needs an `authorization` note, a
//! `ComposeEffectIntent` and an ack (crate::effects). Anything it cannot
//! verify, any duplicate and any run that does not commit is refused with a
//! named error (`PROPOSAL_REFUSED <Name>: ...`), never dropped.
//!
//! Hash semantics (both are reported, never conflated):
//! - `approved_proposal_sha256`: sha256 of the compact JSON object
//!   `{"content":..,"path":..}` with sorted keys, as interplane#77 computes it.
//! - `compose_proposal_sha256`: sha256 of the committed proposal text
//!   (`filename: <path>\n<content>`), the value `aien compose authorize` puts
//!   in the authorization grant and `ComposeEffectIntent` must repeat.
//!
//! Authentication (#249 A, crate::approved_auth): `approval_mac` must be the
//! approval desk key's HMAC over every approved field, else `Unauthenticated`.
//! Replay (#249 B, crate::approved_replay): the approval is claimed durably
//! in the Cortex journal before the run and settled after it (committed,
//! failed, uncertain); a claimed request id, approval id or approval key is
//! refused for ever, across restarts.
//!
//! Design note: docs/COMPOSE_PROPOSER_HOOK.md.
