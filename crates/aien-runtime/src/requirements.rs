//! Requirement validation for composed documents.
//!
//! A task goal can state a measurable requirement ("in at least 20 lines",
//! "sections titled A, B and C", "covers preparing and testing"). This module
//! defines a small typed set of requirements, extracts them deterministically
//! from the goal text ([`analyze`], in `requirements_extract`), and checks the
//! COMPLETE parsed document (the content that would be saved).
//!
//! ## Two outcomes of reading a goal
//!
//! [`analyze`] returns an [`Extraction`]: the RECOGNIZED requirements, and the
//! UNCERTAIN spans. An uncertain span is goal text that looks like an explicit
//! measurable requirement (a bound word and a number next to a document
//! noun, "titled", "covers", "include the word", ...) that extraction could
//! not interpret reliably. Uncertainty is never treated as satisfied: the
//! task is refused before any model call, the report lists the spans
//! (`ComposeTaskReport::requirements_uncertain`) and nothing is approved,
//! committed or written.
//!
//! ## Supported requirements
//!
//! The exact wordings are in the table of `requirements_extract`; in short:
//! counts (`at least|at most|no fewer than|no more than|a minimum of|up to|
//! more than|fewer than|N or more|N or fewer` with digits or number words
//! one..twenty) of lines, words, list items, steps, sections/headings and
//! questions; section titles (`sections titled A, B and C`), topics
//! (`covers A, B and C`), required words and phrases, and a minimum number
//! of sentences in every section; and a markdown heading as the first line
//! (`start with a Markdown heading line that begins with "# "`).
//!
//! ## What a requirement is judged on
//!
//! The COMPLETE document that would be saved (in edit mode the merged file,
//! not the model's reply). An edit only adds lines, so a prior file that
//! already exceeds a `MaxLines` is refused before any attempt.
//!
//! `AddedLines` (a request such as "add 2 lines to README.md") is the one requirement
//! measured against the PRIOR file: the number of non-empty lines of the complete
//! proposed bytes that are not in the longest common subsequence with the
//! prior file's non-empty lines (trailing whitespace ignored). A new file is
//! compared with an empty prior. Callers bind the prior with
//! `Extraction::resolved`; an unresolved `AddedLines` is unmet (fails closed).
//! An edit may only ADD: every non-empty line of the prior file must survive in
//! order (trailing whitespace may differ), otherwise the requirement is unmet
//! whatever the number of added lines. Replacing or deleting lines is a change the
//! goal did not ask for, so "add 2 lines" can never wipe or rewrite the file.
//! The approved path binds the file found in the workspace.
//!
//! Counting: `MinLines`/`MaxLines` count every non-empty line of the file,
//! INCLUDING code lines and code-fence marker lines; `MinWords`/`MaxWords`
//! count every whitespace-separated word of the file. Sections, questions,
//! items, steps, headings, topics and sentences skip fenced code blocks
//! (``` or ~~~, CommonMark close rule: same marker, at least as long, no
//! info string; an unclosed fence runs to the end) and the fence lines
//! themselves, so a `# comment` or a `- x` inside a code block is not a
//! heading or an item.
//!
//! Definitions used by the checks:
//! - heading text: the heading line without its `#` run, leading numbering
//!   (`1.`, `2)`), emphasis marks and trailing `:.!?#`, trimmed, whitespace
//!   collapsed, compared case-insensitively.
//! - word form (topics): lowercase, strip ONE suffix of `ment ing ion es ed
//!   s` (only when 3 or more letters remain; not the `s` of a final `ss`), then one trailing `e` (when 4
//!   or more letters remain). `preparing`, `prepare` and `prepared` agree;
//!   `publishing` and `public` do not. A word whose suffix was stripped also
//!   matches with a final `i` as `y` and with a doubled final consonant
//!   undoubled, so `dry`, `dried` and `drying`, `label`, `labelled` and
//!   `labelling`, `run` and `running` agree (`fill` and `file`, `ski` and
//!   `sky` do not). A topic word ending in `age` or `ages` also matches
//!   without it when 4 letters remain, by a verb form only: the topic
//!   `storage` is covered by `store` or `stored`, `postage` not by `post`
//!   (sc#332). Irregular forms (`withdrew` / `withdraw`)
//!   do not agree: the check errs on the side of refusing, unless the goal
//!   names the form for that topic, written into the topic as `withdraw (or
//!   withdrew)`.
//! - sentence: a run of at least two words ended by `.`, `!` or `?` (not
//!   inside a number such as `3.10`); an unfinished last fragment of at
//!   least three words counts as one. List markers are ignored.
//! - section (for sentence counts): a heading and the prose directly under
//!   it up to the next heading of any level. A heading with no prose of its
//!   own whose next heading is deeper is a container, not a section.
