//! ALLEN identity gate (aien-architecture ADR 0035, aienos ADR 0018).
//!
//! RESOLVE ONLY. This crate reads a kind-24 SubjectState object that AIENOS
//! provisioned and exported; it never creates, encodes or edits one (I8: ALLEN
//! is never created implicitly). The logical agent identity, the machine id
//! (host pin record) and the model binding (deployment record) are three
//! separate records; KV state is in none of them.
//!
//! Opt-in: engaged only when `AIEN_ALLEN_SUBJECT` is set. When engaged every
//! refusal is fatal (see [`EXIT_REFUSED`]); there is never a silent fallback.
